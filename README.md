## Motivation
Our motivation for this project was discussed between two of our memebers before the team was grouped, however they felt they wanted to make a news website featuring world-wide news. There are other website made where you can watch tv shows or series from around the world, so why not world news?
## Future Development
* Migrating away from Heroku; Digial Ocean, Humalect or Netlify.
* Search Bar to Look for Locations; Look Through the Existing APIs for the Search Bar
* Having The Option to Look at City and Town News Rather Than Just Country.
* Using Flags and New Source Icons to match the Country Where the News is Being Retrieved From.
* Adding a Secction in the User's Homepage That Pulls All Default News Headlines Chosen From Registration.
* Adding a Page for "Request Again" After Sending an Email of Forgetting Password, Requesting a Code before Confirming New Password.
